# Sorter

Provides a visualisation of how sorting algorithms work, allowing the user to pick from 5 sorting algorithms (selection sort, insertion sort, bubble sort, merge sort and quick sort), along with the amount of elements to sort and the delay between doing each comparison (so that the user can see how the sort progresses).
